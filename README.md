# 01010111 FLIXEL TEMPLATE

Hi! This is a template I would use for jams! It should get you rolling really really quickly.

## Getting Started

- First make sure you have Haxe (at least 4.X.X) and Flixel installed and working
- Use the latest zerolib-flixel - `haxelib git zerolib-flixel https://github.com/01010111/zerolib-flixel`
- From this github repo, click "Use this template"
- Give your repo a wonderful name
- Clone your repo to your computer
- Start coding in `source/states/PlayState.hx`!
- Jump into Project.xml and change the title, file name, and author
- Edit this readme to introduce people to your game :)

**Using VSCode? (you should)**

- Make sure the `Lime` extension is installed
- Install the `Live Server` extension
- Set Lime's target to `HTML5 / Debug`
- Build your project (`Ctrl + Shift + B`)
- Right click on `export/html5/bin/index.html` and click `Open with Live Server`
- Build your project again and that window will refresh with the new version!

## Features

- import.hx has already imported most of the things you'll need
- configurable controller - just use `CONTROLLER`!
- access public members of your playstate - just use `PLAYSTATE` anywhere!
- folders are set up for project files and assets
- AssetPaths has been split into Audio, Data, and Images for easier access to assets
- Project.xml is streamlined a little bit for easier legibility
